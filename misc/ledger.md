### This is a list of all of the modification that I have made on this website for homework two.

## Bootstrap navigation bar to each page with active links. I have used the <nav> tag for semantic reasons as well, but this is subject to change.
## Added a responsive medium bootstrap container layout to each of the page.
## I have attached my own style sheet to each page to go along with the bootstrap stylesheet.
## jQuery, popper, and javascript added to each page
